# Linux Compatibility Fixes Applied

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Linux Line Endings**
- ‚úÖ **Issue**: Windows CRLF line endings causing `$'\r': command not found` errors
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Converted all shell scripts to Unix LF line endings
- ‚úÖ **Tool**: `convert_to_linux.ps1` script created and executed
- ‚úÖ **Result**: All scripts now have proper Unix line endings and UTF-8 encoding without BOM

### 2. **Fixed Device Detection for Build Environments**
- ‚úÖ **Issue**: Script trying to verify `/dev/mmcblk0` in Ubuntu build environment
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Added build environment detection logic
- ‚úÖ **Location**: `core/build_rg35xxh.sh`
- ‚úÖ **Result**: Script now detects build vs device environment and skips device operations when appropriate

### 3. **Fixed Build vs Device Environment Handling**
- ‚úÖ **Backup Operations**: Only run on target device, skipped in build environment
- ‚úÖ **Ramdisk Extraction**: Uses dummy ramdisk in build environment, real extraction on device
- ‚úÖ **Module Installation**: Installs to build directory instead of trying to mount device partitions
- ‚úÖ **Flashing**: Skipped in build environment, only attempted on actual device

### 4. **Fixed Script Execution Method**
- ‚úÖ **Issue**: main.sh was using `source` which caused variable inheritance issues
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Changed to direct script execution with proper exit code handling
- ‚úÖ **Result**: Better isolation between scripts and proper error propagation

### 5. **Created Debug and Setup Tools**
- ‚úÖ **debug_build_issue.sh**: Comprehensive debug script to identify environment issues
- ‚úÖ **setup_linux_environment.sh**: Complete Linux environment setup script
- ‚úÖ **make_executable.sh**: Makes all scripts executable in Linux

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ **What Works Now**
1. All scripts have proper Linux line endings
2. Scripts can be executed without carriage return errors
3. Build environment properly detected as Ubuntu/development
4. Device operations skipped when not on target device
5. Build process should complete successfully and create artifacts

### üîß **What to Run in Linux**

#### **First Time Setup:**
```bash
# Make setup script executable and run it
chmod +x setup_linux_environment.sh
./setup_linux_environment.sh
```

#### **Or Manual Setup:**
```bash
# Make all scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh
find . -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;

# Install dependencies
./main.sh --install-deps

# Run build
./main.sh --build-rg35xxh
```

#### **If You Still Have Issues:**
```bash
# Run debug script
chmod +x debug_build_issue.sh
./debug_build_issue.sh
```

## Expected Behavior in Ubuntu Build Environment

### ‚úÖ **What Should Happen:**
1. **Device Detection**: Script detects build environment (no `/dev/mmcblk0`)
2. **Tool Check**: Verifies build tools, notes device tools as optional
3. **Environment**: Sets `BUILD_TARGET="build"`
4. **Kernel Build**: Downloads, configures, and builds kernel successfully
5. **Modules**: Installs to `modules_output/` directory
6. **Boot Image**: Creates `boot-new.img` file
7. **Output**: Shows success message with artifact locations

### ‚úÖ **What Should NOT Happen:**
1. ‚ùå No `lsblk: /dev/mmcblk0: not a block device` errors
2. ‚ùå No device backup attempts
3. ‚ùå No partition mounting attempts
4. ‚ùå No flashing attempts

## Files Generated in Build Environment

After successful build, you should see:
- `boot-new.img` - Boot image for flashing
- `modules_output/` - Directory with kernel modules
- `linux/` - Kernel source directory
- `backups/` - Empty directory (no device backups)

## Next Steps for Device Flashing

To flash the built artifacts to the actual device:
1. Copy the entire build directory to the target device
2. Run the build script on the target device where `/dev/mmcblk0` exists
3. Or use the flash utilities in the `flash/` directory

The build environment separation ensures you can develop and build safely on Ubuntu without affecting any actual hardware devices.
