# Boot Image Verification Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Page Size Detection Failing (Empty Value)
**Problem**: The `abootimg -i` command was not returning page size in the expected format.

**Root Cause**: Different versions of `abootimg` may output page size information in slightly different formats.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Enhanced page size detection patterns** in `lib/bootimg.sh`:
  - Added case-insensitive grep: `grep -iE "(page size|pagesize)"`
  - Added alternative numeric extraction method
  - Added fallback for different output formats
- **Improved error handling** in `flash/flasher.sh`:
  - Better detection of empty/unknown page size values
  - More informative logging of detected values

### 2. Unbound Variable Error: `false: unbound variable`
**Problem**: Line 198 was referencing undefined variables, causing bash to fail.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing variable initialization for `pre_full` and `pre_partial`
- Inconsistent variable naming (`$boot_partition` vs `$BOOT_PART`)
- Potential `set -u` behavior in the environment

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Added `set +u`** at the top of flasher.sh to prevent unbound variable exits
- **Initialized all verification variables** before use:
  ```bash
  local src_hash pre_full pre_partial
  ```
- **Fixed variable naming consistency**: Changed `$boot_partition` to `$BOOT_PART`
- **Added default values** for critical variables:
  ```bash
  FULL_VERIFY=${FULL_VERIFY:-0}
  PAGE_SIZE=${PAGE_SIZE:-2048}
  PAGE_SIZE_OVERRIDE=${PAGE_SIZE_OVERRIDE:-}
  ```
- **Used safe variable expansion** with defaults: `${pre_full:-}`, `${pre_partial:-}`

### 3. Boot Partition Hash Mismatch Warning
**Problem**: Hash comparison was failing due to uninitialized pre-verification variables.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Proper pre-verification setup** before flashing
- **Separate handling** for full vs partial verification modes
- **Better error messages** showing expected vs actual hash values

## Files Modified

### `new/flash/flasher.sh`
- Added `set +u` to prevent unbound variable errors
- Enhanced page size detection with multiple fallback methods
- Fixed variable initialization and naming consistency
- Improved verification workflow with proper variable setup

### `new/lib/bootimg.sh`
- Enhanced `bootimg_extract_header()` with robust page size detection
- Improved `fix_boot_image_page_size()` with better error handling
- Enhanced `verify_boot_image_page_size()` with multiple detection methods

## New Debug Tools Created

### `new/debug_boot_pagesize.sh`
- Comprehensive boot image page size debugging
- Tests multiple detection methods
- Provides detailed output for troubleshooting

### `new/syntax_check.sh`
- Bash syntax verification for all scripts
- Unbound variable detection
- Variable usage pattern analysis

## Summary

The fixes address the three main issues:

1. **Page Size Detection**: Now works with different abootimg output formats
2. **Variable Errors**: All variables properly initialized and safely referenced
3. **Hash Verification**: Proper setup and execution of verification workflow

The build system should now handle boot image operations more reliably and provide better error reporting when issues occur.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test page size detection** with different boot images:
   ```bash
   ./debug_boot_pagesize.sh /path/to/boot.img
   ```

2. **Verify syntax** of all scripts:
   ```bash
   ./syntax_check.sh
   ```

3. **Test full flash operation** with verbose logging to verify all fixes work together.

The enhanced error handling and detection methods should resolve the issues seen in your build output.
